# Manuscript Figures
This portion of the repository contains the scripts used to generate the figures in the manuscript. Each script is 
appropriately named with the figure number used in the manuscript. At the beginning of each script is a comment 
describing the figure number, the manuscript, and the potential caption for the figure. Some of the code was written 
to perform specific analysis which are not presented in the figures. Therefore, some portions of the scripts can be 
removed for efficiency reasons, if needed.
